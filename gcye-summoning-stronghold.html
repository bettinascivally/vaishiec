So I've been in a big fantasy mood lately, but I don't have a lot of experience with the fantasy genre and was hoping for some book suggestions. I'm looking for something medium-length (say, not more than around 500 pages). I don't really have a subgenre preference; however, I'm in the mood for reading a book about dungeon crawling, or a really magical/mystical book (I really like reading about magic overall) set in winter (I'm in Finland right now and it's really snowy and dark and magical. 
Summoning's first song with programmed drums (recorded in the spring of 1995) was featured exclusively on the 1995 Napalm Records compilation CD With Us or Against.

If a player summons the lucky god Fukurokuju - a Stronghold Daimyo, or Jinmenju which allows summoning like a Stronghold, can that player immediately summon another unit via their ability? Also, could Fukurokuju be built like a Stronghold during the Marshal. The Vigilants go on and on about how they won't suffer a Daedra worshipper to live, yet there are races on Tamriel that worship their patron Daedra. The Dark Elves worship Boethiah, Mephala, and Azura, two of which can easily be seen as rather evil. The Orcs worship Malacath as well, the corrupted spirit of the god who made them. (I think, I've only read what the True Nature of Orcs has to say on the matter.) My point is, why don't the Vigilants go on a genocide of the Dunmer that worship.

Sadly, DampD is a game about adventure, so I've never seen anything other than the typical adventure uses for magic in any rules. Does anyone know of any homebrew magic rules that could be applicable for day to day conveniences.

Hello all, as the title suggests this post is all about how the epic teams need to put in a guild system. Everything typed past here is just my idea on how the devs could go about a guild system. No need to read as it’s just my personal opinion and thoughts on what I would like to see, and it will mention a bunch of non announced/existing game features. For the first part of the guild system I would like to talk about the idea of a guild hall. This would be a separate map location that would. Исполнитель: Summoning Альбом: Stronghold Студия: Irond.
